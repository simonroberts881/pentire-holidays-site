            </div>
            <div>

                <p>Clients applying to book a property are referred to as "The Tenants".</p>
                <p>Any contract is between the Tenants and the Owners, who are responsible for providing the property to the Tenant in the appropriate condition. The names and addresses of the Owners can be provided on request. The Agents act only as agents for the Owners and are not Principals.</p>

                <h3>Your booking and Payments</h3>
                <p>Bookings will only be accepted on receipt of a completed booking form and follow the
                    â€œsize & party" conditions below. Payment of 30% of the cost of the holiday if more than
                    six weeks before the start of the rental, (excluding the good housekeeping bond) is due
                    within 5 working days. The Tenants are liable for the outstanding balance, six weeks
                    before the start of the tenancy.</p>
                <p>If a booking is made six weeks or more before the tenancy is due to start it must be accompanied by a deposit of 30% of the total cost of the booking.</p>
                <p>If a booking is made less than six weeks before the start of the holiday, the full rent must be paid at the time of booking. Payments are accepted by BACS.</p>
                <p>Rental rates quoted, are for 4 people using 2 bedrooms. A sofa bed is available for 2 additional guests at an additional cost.</p>
                <p>Any charges raised against the Agents by their bank for handling any form of payment, or charges for dishonoured cheques, or charges for overseas transfers, will be passed onto the Tenants who are liable to reimburse the Agents within 7 days of notification.</p>

                <h3>Conditions of Size & Party</h3>
                <p>The person who books the holiday, must be:- </p>

                <p>Unless expressly agreed in advance by the Agents, no group bookings (four or more adult party members) are accepted where all party members are under 25 years of age. Unless, expressly agreed in advance by the Agents, no group bookings are accepted where all members are of the same sex, unless the group consists of members of the same family across a number of generations. The Owner and Agent reserve the right to refuse access to the property without compensation where no agreement has been given in advance.</p>

                <h3>The Tenancy</h3>
                <p>The Tenancy confers upon the Tenants the right to occupy for a holiday within the meaning of schedule 1, Paragraph 9 of the Housing Act 1988. The Tenants agree:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Occupancy of more people or guests than specified on the Booking Form and/or the number the Property holds, attempt to take up occupation;</li>

                    <li>Not to part with possession of the property or share it except with members of the party as shown on the booking form. </li>
                    <li>To pay for any losses or damage to the property however caused (reasonable wear and tear excepted)</li>
                    <li>To leave the property in the same state of cleanliness which it was found at the commencement of your holiday. Any extra cleaning over and beyond what is considered to be normal, will be charged to the Guest and deducted from the 'Good Housekeeping bond'.</li>
